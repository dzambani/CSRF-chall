## Requirements

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Install Node Modules

Like any node project, you will need to download and install the required node modules for the project to run: 

```bash
npm install
```
This command installs the node modules needed to run the project in a new directory named `node_modules`.

Once the modules have finished installing, you can run the project like this:
```bash
npm start
```

You should see the following if everything is OK:
```
Server started and listening at localhost:3000
```
